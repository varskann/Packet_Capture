** This folder contains two .py files:
1. create_db.py: Parse the .pcap file and create the database of requests and responses.
2. proxy.py: To set up a proxy server and get the response from the database instead of getting it from the server.

To Run:
=======
Install	Pynids, dpkt, CherryProxy, logging, sqlite3 modules to run the code.

Change the name of the .pcap file in the proxy.py script for which we want to run the replay
and move the .pcap file to this folder.


Command:	python proxy.py -a ADDRESS -p PORT

		ADDRESS: address on which we want to run the proxy server
		PORT: port on which we want to run the proxy server


Commnets:
=========
proxy.py automatically runs the create_db.py file (which creates the "newdb.db" database)
and starts a proxy server at given address and port.
